# Forest-Animals-Detecton-Python
This project was part of a college exam. The project involved training a raw AI model to detect objects. I chose to recognize 9 species of forest animals(wolf, squirrel, roe deer, deer, elk, badger, wild boar, fox, bear), which ended with a decent result. 
## The project process was as follows:
1. Collecting images needed to train the model. All of them are collected from Google images under free licenses. About 20 images are prepared for each animal species and several images combined to provide good conditions for training the model.

2. Marking the appropriate classes on the images in Label Studio

3. Preparing the environment and the necessary scripts for training the model

4. Training the model

5. Exporting the trained model to the machine for deeper testing

A PDF file contains whole project documentation but in polish.
